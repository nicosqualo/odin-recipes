        <li>1/2 Onion</li>    
        <li>2 carrots</li> 
        <li>Celery</li> 
        <li>2 slices of garlic</li>
        <li>A glass of still white wine</li> 
        <li>Two glasses of Tomato sauce</li> 
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>  
        <li>A glass of oil</li> 
        <li>One vegetable stock cube</li> 
        <li>water</li> 
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the carrots, the onion and the celery into tiny pieces and put them in a big pot with the garlic, the oil and half a glass of wine. Cook for 5 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the stock cube, the rest of the wine, the tomato sauce, the minced meat to the pot. Cook with medium heat and with the cover on. </li>
        <li>make sure the meat is not dry: there should always be a thin layer of liquid covering it all (oil+tomato sauce+wine). If it's not the case, add water until that level is reached.</li>
        <li>Add salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Stir every half an hour or so. The sauce takes three hours to cook.</li>
        <li>Let it cool down and put it in the freezer/fridge. The sauce it's better the next day. </li>
    </ol>
